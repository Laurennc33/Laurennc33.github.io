Assignment: Personal Website Using GitHub Pages

In this assignment, you will create a personal website using GitHub Pages. 
The website will introduce you or showcase something you’re passionate about—whether it's a hobby, academic interest, or a project. 
This assignment will help you become familiar with GitHub Pages, HTML, CSS, and how to deploy your website online.

Requirements:

+ Website Structure (20 points): Your website must consist of at least two pages. 
  You are free to structure the site based on the content you wish to highlight, but the following sections are required:
    + Home Page (index.html) (5 points):
        + A clear heading (e.g., "Welcome to My Website" or "About Me").
        + A short introduction about yourself or the topic you are interested in. (At least 200 words)
        + At least one image (e.g., your photo or something that represents your interests).
    + A second page (or more) that expands on the details. This could include (5 points):
        + Descriptive text explaining the content (At least 200 words)
        + At least one image (e.g., your photo or something that represents your interests).
        + A list (ordered or unordered) about the topic.
        + A heading smaller than the one on the Home Page.
    + Contact Information: Include a contact section (which could be on any of your pages) 
      with links to your email or social media accounts. (5 points)
    + Navigation: Your site should have clear navigation between pages, either via a header menu or links, 
      so visitors can move seamlessly between the Home and Additional Page(s). (5 points)

+ Styling & Customization (15 points): Style your website using custom CSS. You must implement three different customizations beyond basic styling. 
  These could include:
    + Custom fonts or typography.
    + Color scheme changes for backgrounds, text, or links.
    + Custom margins, padding, or layout adjustments.

+ Deployment (5 points): Once your website is complete, ensure it is published on GitHub Pages. 
  Double-check that all links and pages work properly before submitting.

Submission:
Also, please submit a Word document or a .txt file which contains:
+ The hyperlink of your website.
+ Describe all the Styling & Customizations you have done in the Website.
